/**
 * A SCREEN OF SETTINGS AN OWNER VISITS ONE PART AT A TIME (D-657): a section menu — a left
 * column from `lg`, a scrolling row at the top on a phone — and one section's content.
 *
 * WHY A SEARCH PARAM AND NOT A ROUTE SEGMENT. `?section=voice` keeps every section on ONE
 * route: the screen's queries, its unsaved drafts and its copilot surface stay mounted
 * while the reader moves between sections, and adding a section is an entry in an array.
 * A `[section]` segment would make each section its own page module (D-196: a page may
 * export only `default`), remount the screen on every switch and drop any unsaved draft,
 * and spread one screen across a folder per section. The URL still addresses each section
 * — it can be bookmarked, shared, reloaded and reached with Back — which is the property
 * the segment would have bought.
 *
 * The menu is links, not tabs: a section has its own URL and Back returns to the previous
 * one. Other search params (the operator's `view_as`) are carried over. When a reader
 * picks a section, focus moves to its heading so a keyboard or screen-reader user lands
 * on what they asked for; a section opened from the URL on first load does not steal
 * focus.
 *
 * ONLY THE OPEN SECTION IS MOUNTED, and a switch asks first when it would lose typing.
 * Keeping every section mounted and hidden was the alternative, and it is the wrong one
 * here: a section that declares a copilot surface (the captured-details editor does)
 * would declare it at page load and, since the registry's newest entry wins, answer for
 * whichever section is actually on screen. So sections mount and unmount cleanly, and any
 * form inside one that uses `useUnsavedGuard` reports its draft to this layout; while one
 * is dirty, choosing another section opens a confirm dialog instead of switching. (The
 * browser's Back button changes the URL without asking; the guard's `beforeunload` half
 * still covers a reload or a closed tab.)
 *
 * Never put a compliance control or its qualifying sentence in a section other than the
 * one that opens first (UX-DOCTRINE §8.7).
