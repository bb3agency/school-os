/**
 * THE SAVE FOR A CHOICE THAT IS ALWAYS ON SCREEN (a voice, a model, what an agent is): it
 * appears only once the choice differs from what is saved, with Cancel beside it, and sticks
 * to the bottom of the window so a long list of options never pushes it out of reach.
 *
 * One bar for every such setting on the agent page and the account's model screen, so a
 * person learns one way to change a thing. A choice that saves the moment it is flipped (a
 * switch) needs no bar; a value edited behind "Change" uses the row's own inline form.
 *
 * Render it inside the `<form>` it submits. The negative bottom offset cancels the shell's
 * bottom padding (`SHELL_MAIN_CLASS`), so the bar sits on the window's edge. On a phone the
 * two buttons take the full width.
