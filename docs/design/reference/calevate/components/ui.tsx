 * ## Why a native checkbox with `role="switch"` and not a styled `<div>`
 *
 * It is keyboard-operable with no JS, it announces its own state, and it is reachable by
 * the a11y sweep. The painted switch is drawn entirely from the input's own `peer` state,
 * so what is on screen and what is checked cannot disagree. The label WRAPS the input
 * (implicit association) rather than carrying an `id`: two editors of two agents on one
 * screen would collide on any id scheme, and the wrapping label is what keeps the axe
 * sweep green without one.

/**
 * A section a reader opens when they want it — the console's ONE disclosure mechanism.
 *
 * ## Why native `<details>` and not a built accordion
 *
 * It is keyboard-operable, it announces its expanded state, it survives a JavaScript
 * failure open-able, and it needs no focus management of our own. The marketing FAQ, the
 * leads column chooser, the admin lifecycle screen and the data-rights screen had each
 * already reached for `<details>` independently; this is that shape hoisted so the fifth
 * caller does not restyle it. (`components/marketing/faq.tsx` argues the same case.)
 *
 * ## When a caller may use it — this is a rule, not a taste
 *
 * The GOV.UK Design System is explicit and this component is held to it: "Do not use the
 * details component to hide information that the majority of your users will need", and
 * its own research records "evidence that some users avoid clicking the link to show more
 * details" (github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system `src/components/details/index.md`,
 * read 25 Aug 2026). So a disclosure is for the rare and the reference — never for a
 * compliance obligation, never for the screen's primary job, and never for something a
 * first-time owner has to find. UX-DOCTRINE §3 carries the decision test.
 *
 * `summary` is the whole control, so it carries `touch:min-h-11` for SC 2.5.8's target
 * size; `subtitle` lets the closed state say what is inside without the reader opening it,
 * which is the "information scent" that makes a disclosure findable at all.
 *
 * ## `variant="inline"` — the same mechanism at strip size
 *
 * A card-shaped panel is the right container for a section. It is the wrong one for a
 * LIST of one-line facts, each of which has a longer sentence behind it: five bordered
 * cards inside a card is a stack of chrome around ten words apiece, and the doc comment
 * above says outright that a disclosed panel is a peer of a card and never nested in one.
 * `variant="inline"` drops the border, the shadow and the padding and keeps everything
 * that makes this component the console's one disclosure: the native `<details>`, the
 * announced state, the Show/Hide affordance in words, and the touch target.
 *
 * It is a VARIANT rather than a second component because the alternative on offer was a
 * hand-rolled `<details>` beside `WhatCallsCost`, which is the thing UX-DOCTRINE §3
 * forbids ("do not hand-roll a second").
 *
 * Two contract differences, both deliberate:
 *
 * - **`headingLevel`.** The card variant's `h2` is a peer of `Card`'s own `h2`. An inline
 *   disclosure sits INSIDE a card's body, under that `h2`, so it takes `3` there —
 *   otherwise the heading list reads as two peers where one contains the other.
 *   `4` is for a disclosure inside one row of a list that sits under an `h3` (a setting's
 *   technical details on the ops configuration screen).
 * - **`subtitle` is not expected.** §3 requires the closed state to carry the FACT rather
 *   than a tease; in the inline variant the TITLE is the fact ("No GST, and no tax
 *   invoice") and the body is only the elaboration, so a subtitle would
 *   be a third line of text on a strip that exists to remove text.

 * A technical or legal term kept verbatim and explained in place.
 *
 * Plain-language guidance (GOV.UK) allows an unavoidable technical term when it is
 * glossed where it is used — this is that mechanism, and the ONLY sanctioned way to put a
 * compliance term (DLT, PE, TM, DND, DPDP, the 140/160 number series) on screen.
 *
 * Prefer `<Term id="dlt" />` (`@/lib/glossary`) to writing the words here: the map is what
 * keeps one term from being explained two ways on two screens. This component is the
 * mechanism; the glossary is the vocabulary.
 *
 * ## Why the gloss is a styled box, not the native `title`
 *
 * The term shows its meaning in a small box on HOVER, on keyboard FOCUS, and on TAP — the
 * three input modes a `title` tooltip fails: `title` is mouse-only, delayed, unstyled, and
 * shows nothing on a touch screen. The `<abbr>` is `tabIndex={0}` so a keyboard user reaches
 * it and a touch user taps it into focus.
 *
 * ## Why the gloss lives in `data-gloss`, NOT as a child text node
 *
 * The box is drawn by `::after { content: attr(data-gloss) }`, so the gloss is a CSS
 * pseudo-element — NOT a DOM text node. That is deliberate and load-bearing: a hidden child
 * `<span>{children}</span>` would still be in the DOM, and because tests run under jsdom
 * (which applies no Tailwind CSS, so `hidden` does not hide) every `getByText`/`textContent`
 * assertion on a screen that uses a term would suddenly also see the gloss. Keeping the gloss
 * in an attribute means the rendered TEXT is exactly the term, on screen and in tests.
 *
 * The gloss is ALSO the accessible name (`aria-label`) so a screen reader announces it, and a
 * `::after` pseudo-element is not part of the accessibility tree — so the meaning is not read
 * twice. No native `title`: it would double the visible tooltip under the styled one.
 *
 * ## TWO DEFECTS A BROWSER FOUND, BOTH INVISIBLE TO jsdom
 *
 * Measured in Chromium against the production Tailwind bundle (the instrument
 * `tests/responsive.test.ts` describes), because jsdom applies no CSS and this component is
 * ENTIRELY CSS. The founder photographed a gloss box that looked "cut off"; it was both of
 * these at once.
 *
 * **1. The box was empty — the gloss text never rendered, on any screen, in any browser.**
 * The class was the arbitrary PROPERTY form of `after:` + `[content: attr(...)]` (spelled
 * without the space, which is why it is not spelled that way here: Tailwind scans comments
 * too, and naming the class in prose is enough to emit a rule for it). Tailwind emits
 * `content: var(--tw-content)` into EVERY `after:` rule it generates, and `--tw-content`
 * defaults to `""` — so `.hover\:after\:block:hover::after` and
 * `.focus\:after\:block:focus::after`, which sort later in the sheet and carry a higher
 * specificity, blanked the content in exactly the two states that reveal the box. Measured:
 * `getComputedStyle(el, "::after").content === '""'`, an 18×10px empty white rectangle.
 * The fix is the `content-[…]` UTILITY, which sets `--tw-content` itself, so every later
 * `content: var(--tw-content)` resolves to the gloss instead of over-writing it.
 *
 * **2. The box was clipped by the shell.** It was `after:absolute after:bottom-full`, whose
 * containing block is the `<abbr>` — inside `<main class="overflow-y-auto">` (a scroll
 * container: `overflow-y: auto` forces the `visible` x-axis to `auto`, so it clips
 * horizontally too) and inside every `ScrollRegion`. Measured at 1280×800: a term in the
 * right-hand column had 106px of a 192px box cut off by `main`'s right edge, and a term in a
 * table inside a `ScrollRegion` lost 16.5px of its 26.5px height off the region's top edge.
 *
 * So the box is now `position: fixed` — which escapes ancestor overflow entirely — with its
 * coordinates written as custom properties by `placeGloss` when the term is hovered, focused
 * or tapped, and kept in step while it is showing. What that buys over the alternatives:
 *
 * - **CSS anchor positioning** (`anchor-name` + `position-area` + `position-try-fallbacks`)
 *   is the pure-CSS answer and needs no listener, but it is not in every browser we serve,
 *   so it would need the clipped `absolute` rules kept underneath as an `@supports`
 *   fallback — two positioning mechanisms in one component, and the fallback is the broken
 *   one. Take it when support is universal; it deletes `placeGloss` and nothing else.
 * - **A portal / the native `popover` attribute** puts a real element in the top layer,
 *   which also solves it — and costs the property the section above is about: the gloss
 *   becomes a DOM text node that every `getByText` on every screen using a term would then
 *   match. Rejected for that, not for the DOM weight.
 *
 * The one place `fixed` does NOT escape is inside an ancestor that carries a transform,
 * filter or `contain`, which becomes the containing block for fixed descendants — an
 * identity `translate-x-0` counts. Nothing glossed today sits in one; the shells' sidebar
 * panel does (`sidebarCollapse.tsx` animates `transform`), so a gloss put INSIDE the
 * sidebar would be placed relative to the panel rather than the viewport.
 *
 * With JS unavailable (a hydration failure, a blocked bundle) the vars are unset, `top`,
 * `left` and `bottom` all resolve to `auto`, and a fixed box at its static position lands
 * beside the term — unclipped, unflipped, still readable. It degrades, it does not vanish.
 *

/**
 * Renders an RFC-9457 problem the way its fields intend.
 *
 * The reason this exists instead of `alert(error.message)`: the API distinguishes a
 * compliance refusal ("this number is on the do-not-call list") from a transient
 * failure, and tells us which is which via `retryable` + `remediation`. Flattening
 * both into "something went wrong" would make the compliance gate look like a bug.
 *
 * ## The hierarchy, and why the support reference moved down it
 *
 * A live sign-in refusal was photographed reading: *"One or more fields are invalid /
 * Correct the fields named in this response and send the request again / password: String
 * should have at least 12 characters / Support reference: 9c83825c…"*. The server half of
 * that is somebody else's fix. THIS half is that four things were given near-equal weight,
 * and the only one that helped — use a longer password — was third.
 *
 * So: the sentence is the loudest thing in the box; what to do next sits under it; and the
 * support reference is shown **only when there is genuinely something for support to look
 * up**. A 4xx is the API telling the person what it needs — a 32-character id beside it is
 * noise that makes a fixable refusal look like an outage. A 5xx, an unclassified failure,
 * or a refusal that names nothing to do, is ours: there the reference is the whole point,
 * because it is what turns "it broke" into a row somebody can find.
 *
 * `break-words` on every element that can hold server prose, because the server puts the
 * CLIENT's own strings in it — the endpoint URL they typed on `/integrations`, a slug, a
 * host. One 300-character token with no space in it walked a 320px card off the screen,
 * and `overflow-wrap` does not inherit past a child that sets its own.

 * The loading state, said out loud as well as drawn.
 *
 * §52's first clause is "loading is a skeleton", and for ~96 sites this component WAS the
 * whole of it — a `<div aria-hidden>` of pulsing bars. To a sighted reader that is the
 * clearest possible statement that an answer is on its way. To a screen-reader user it
 * was nothing at all: the bars were hidden from the accessibility tree and no text
 * replaced them, so a screen that had refused to lie in pixels was silent in the one
 * modality where silence and "there is nothing here" are the same thing. That is P7.1's
 * defect on the audience `tests/a11y.ts` names, and `a11y.ts:42` says out loud that the
 * axe sweep cannot see it: axe checks the markup that exists, not the announcement that
 * never happens.
 *
 * **`role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"` on the container, an `sr-only` label inside
 * it, and `aria-hidden` kept on the bars.** That is the researched shape rather than an
 * invention — Adrian Roselli, "More Accessible Skeletons"; Semrush Intergalactic's
 * skeleton a11y guidance ("place skeleton loaders inside a container with role='status'
 * and aria-live='polite' … for the screen reader to announce the start of the loading
 * process"); MDN on `aria-busy`.
 *
 * **`aria-busy` is deliberately NOT here**, and that is a departure from the obvious fix.
 * `aria-busy` is a property of the region whose CONTENTS are changing, so it belongs on
 * the card or table that is about to be filled, not on the placeholder that will be
 * removed (vuetifyjs/vuetify#10999 makes exactly this correction). Putting it on the
 * skeleton marks the skeleton itself as busy, which is both untrue and useless. Doing it
 * properly means `aria-busy` on ~96 containers, which is a change to the call sites and
 * not to this component.
 *
 * **What this does not give**, stated rather than implied: it announces the START of a
 * load. It cannot announce the ARRIVAL, because a live region has to be in the document
 * when the change happens and this one is removed by the change. Saying "loaded" would
 * need a region that outlives the skeleton, in both shells, fed by every screen — a
 * different mechanism, and one that would say "loaded" 96 times a session unless it also
 * knew which loads a reader cares about.
 *
 * `label` names what is loading, because "Loading…" four times on one screen tells a

 * "0.0000" are all zero and no string comparison spots that; a single digit other than
 * zero anywhere in the string is exactly the condition, and it holds for every decimal
 * form the server can send. It usually picks a HINT rather than a figure — which is
 * precisely how the habit hard rule 7 is about survives to the line where it does matter.
 *
 * Here rather than beside a caller because it now has two: the usage screen asks it of
 * overage minutes and of the model surcharge, and the credit-pack table asks it of a
 * bonus percentage. Two spellings of one rule is where the drift starts.

/**
 * `formatIST`'s doctrine in the shape `<input type="datetime-local">` speaks — the pair
 * of conversions for a field whose value is IST BY NATURE rather than by who is looking.
 *
 * ## The bug this exists to make unwriteable
 *
 * `datetime-local` has no timezone in it, and both halves of the naive round trip read the
 * BROWSER's clock: `date.getHours()` on the way in and `new Date("2026-08-04T14:30")` on
 * the way out. That is correct on a machine set to India and silently wrong everywhere
 * else — and D-22's "view as client" plus a colleague on a laptop still set to a US zone
 * make "everywhere else" a real session rather than a hypothetical. The value it corrupts
 * is not the operator's: it is the timestamp on an Indian registrar's letter, which says
 * one thing and would be stored as another.
 *
 * ## Why the two directions are spelled differently, and why that is not two ways
 *
 * Both name ONE fact — the wall clock in India — and this repo already fixed each half
 * once. Forward, `Intl` is asked for the parts in `Asia/Kolkata`, which is what `formatIST`
 * above does and what `lib/api/invoice.ts` does for the billing month; `formatToParts` is
 * used rather than a formatted string so nothing depends on where a locale puts its comma.
 * Backward, the `+05:30` is WRITTEN IN, which is what `campaigns.ts::scheduleStartAt` and
 * `recurrenceUntil` do and for the identical reason recorded there. Going backwards
 * through `Intl` would mean solving for the offset at an instant we do not yet have —
 * machinery whose only purpose would be to rediscover a constant. India has observed
 * UTC+05:30 with no daylight saving since 1945 and IANA lists no future transition for
 * `Asia/Kolkata`; "IST" names that offset, which is why the input is labelled IST on
 * screen wherever this is used.
 *
 * A LABEL IS PART OF THIS CONTRACT, not decoration. An unlabelled `datetime-local` that
 * quietly means something other than the machine's clock is worse than the bug it fixes,
 * because the reader has no way to tell which one they are typing.

 * - `new Date("2026-08-10T00:00:00")` is midnight in the BROWSER's zone, which is the

 *   previous IST date outright — Auckland midnight is 16:30 IST the day before — so the
 *   same digits record a different day depending on who typed them, and the value is
 *   then read back with `formatIST`, which is where the disagreement becomes visible.
 * - Midnight IST is the earliest instant of the day the person actually picked, in the
 *   zone every reader of it is in. It is never in the future when the day is not.
 *
 * Separate from `istInputToInstant` rather than folded into it: that one takes a
 * `datetime-local` and would silently accept a bare date by appending nothing, and a
 * helper that guesses which of two input types it was handed is a helper that guesses.
